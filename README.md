# Obsidian note archiver

This is a simple note archiver utility. Some of my workflows need to move files to different locations so I can keep
my workspace clean. This plugin helps move those documents to an archive folder

- New command in command palette
- Archive button in the editor menu
- Archive button in the file menu

## Simply move your file to a folder

You can set the plugin to move files to a particular folder:
